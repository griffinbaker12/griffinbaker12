Hi, my name is griffin ðŸ‘‹

I love to build beautiful things.

I recently finished a deep work tracker (https://github.com/griffinbaker12/deep-work-tracker) and am working on a mobile app called Headout (soon to be released to the App Store).

I have shipped several apps to the App Store, the latest being WYD: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wyd-keep-in-touch/id6447770949.

My favorite languages are Python and Swift. Functional languages are pretty cool as well.
