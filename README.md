Hi, my name is Griffin ðŸ‘‹

I love to build beautiful things.

I'm currently working on a voice-enabled AI assistant, optimized for running on the raspberry pi. Think [humane ai pin](https://humane.com), but for frontline workers. 

Iâ€™ve also shipped four apps to the App Store, collectively downloaded and used by thousands of people. The most successful, WYD, peaked at over 400 daily active users.

Some other projects I've worked on recently are:
- an [ascii art converter](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/ascii-art/) in Python
- building a [computer from scratch](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/nand2tetris)
- an [extensible tool](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/git-ignore-updater) that makes it easier to create `.gitignore` files
- training a [mnist classifier](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network) to 99% accuracy using only NumPy
- a [json parser](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/JSONParser) from scratch in Python
- a [particle visualizer](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/particle-viz) in Lua using the Love2d game engine
- a [deep work tracker](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/deep-work-tracker) in Python (cli tool)
- contributing to the new [comma connect web app](https://github.com/commaai/new-connect)

My favorite language is (currently) Python. Functional languages are pretty cool as well ([but dumb when strictly defined](https://youtu.be/ovYbgbrQ-v8?si=EhHlj2VXE1yXM7t2&t=1947)).
