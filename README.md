Hi, my name is griffin ðŸ‘‹

I love to build beautiful things.

I recently finished a deep work tracker (https://github.com/griffinbaker12/deep-work-tracker), my first Chrome Extension (https://github.com/griffinbaker12/blue-check-remover), and am working on a mobile app called Headout (soon to be released to the App Store).

I shipped 3 apps to the App Store over the past 2.5 years, the latest being WYD: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wyd-keep-in-touch/id6447770949.

My favorite languages is (currently) Python. Functional languages are pretty cool as well.
