Hi, my name is Griffin ðŸ‘‹

I love to build beautiful things.

Some projects I've worked on recently are:
- building a [computer from scratch](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/nand2tetris)
- an [extensible tool](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/git-ignore-updater) that makes it easier to create `.gitignore` files
- contributing to the new [comma connect web app](https://github.com/commaai/new-connect)
- training a [mnist classifier](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network) to 99% accuracy using _**only NumPy**_
- a [json parser](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/JSONParser) from scratch in Python
- a [deep work tracker](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/deep-work-tracker) in Python (cli tool)

I've also shipped 3 apps to the App Store over the past 2.5 years that have been downloaded and used by thousands of people, the most successful one being [WYD](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wyd-keep-in-touch/id6447770949).

My favorite languages is (currently) Python. Functional languages are pretty cool as well (but dumb when strictly defined).
