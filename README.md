Hi, my name is griffin ðŸ‘‹

I love to build beautiful things.

Some projects I've worked on recently are:
- [mnist classifier](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network)
- [json parser](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/JSONParser)
- [deep work tracker](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/deep-work-tracker)
- [chrome extension](https://github.com/griffinbaker12/blue-check-remover)

I've also shipped 3 apps to the App Store over the past 2.5 years, the latest being [WYD](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wyd-keep-in-touch/id6447770949). I am working currently working on another called Headout (soon to be released to the App Store).

My favorite languages is (currently) Python. Functional languages are pretty cool as well (but dumb when strictly defined).
